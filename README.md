## Retail Sales Data Analysis

### Overview
This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data to uncover patterns in sales trends, top-performing products, customer behavior, and revenue generation. By studying this data, the goal is to provide insights that can help optimize sales strategies and enhance business performance.

### Data Source
The dataset for this project is sourced from the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition. It includes transaction records from three retail branches in Mandalay, Yangon, and Naypyitaw.

### Objectives
- Determine the best-performing branches and product lines.
- Analyze sales patterns across different timeframes (daily, monthly).
- Understand customer purchasing behavior.
- Evaluate sales strategies and suggest improvements.

### Analytical Approaches
#### Product Analysis
- Identify the best and worst-performing product lines.
- Analyze revenue contribution by each product line.
- Determine the most popular payment method.

#### Sales Analysis
- Track sales trends over different days and months.
- Identify peak sales hours and busiest days.
- Compare branch-wise sales performance.

#### Customer Analysis
- Segment customers based on purchasing patterns.
- Analyze gender distribution per branch.
- Determine the most profitable customer segment.
- Identify peak hours for customer ratings.

### Data Processing Steps
#### 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Checked for and handled missing or inconsistent values.
- Structured the dataset into an SQL database.
- Enforced data integrity through constraints.

#### 2. Feature Engineering
- Added a `time_of_day` feature to classify transactions into Morning, Afternoon, or Evening.
- Extracted `day_name` and `month_name` for analyzing sales trends by weekdays and months.

#### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical and graphical analysis were conducted to extract key business insights.

### Business Questions To Answer
#### Generic Questions
- How many unique cities does the data have?
- In which city is each branch?

#### Product
- How many unique product lines does the data have?
- What is the most common payment method?

- What product line had the largest revenue?
- What is the city with the largest revenue?
- What product line had the largest VAT?
- Fetch each product line and add a column to those product lines showing "Good", "Bad". Good if it's greater than average sales.
- Which branch sold more products than the average product sold?
- What is the most common product line by gender?
- What is the average rating of each product line?

#### Sales
- Number of sales made in each time of the day per weekday.
- Which of the customer types brings the most revenue?
- Which city has the largest tax percent/ VAT (Value Added Tax)?
- Which customer type pays the most in VAT?

#### Customer

### Revenue & Profit Formulas
- **COGS (Cost of Goods Sold):** `unit_price * quantity`
- **VAT (5% of COGS):** `0.05 * COGS`
- **Total Revenue:** `COGS + VAT`
- **Gross Profit:** `Total Revenue - COGS`
- **Gross Margin (%):** `(Gross Profit / Total Revenue) * 100`

### Example Calculation
For a transaction with:
- **Unit Price** = $45.79
- **Quantity** = 7

Computed Values:
- **COGS** = `45.79 * 7 = 320.53`
- **VAT** = `0.05 * 320.53 = 16.03`
- **Total Revenue** = `320.53 + 16.03 = 336.56`
- **Gross Margin** = `(16.03 / 336.56) * 100 â‰ˆ 4.76%`
