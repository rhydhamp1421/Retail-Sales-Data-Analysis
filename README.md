# Retail Sales Data Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data to uncover patterns in sales trends, top-performing products, customer behavior, and revenue generation. By studying this data, the goal is to provide insights that can help optimize sales strategies and enhance business performance.

## Data Source
The dataset for this project is sourced from the [Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting). It includes transaction records from three retail branches in Mandalay, Yangon, and Naypyitaw.

## Objectives
- Determine the best-performing branches and product lines.
- Analyze sales patterns across different timeframes (daily, monthly).
- Understand customer purchasing behavior.
- Evaluate sales strategies and suggest improvements.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains 1000 records with the following key attributes:

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| invoice_id | Unique identifier for each transaction |
| branch | Store branch where the sale was recorded |
| city | City where the branch is located |
| customer_type | Category of customer (e.g., member, non-member) |
| gender | Customer's gender |
| product_line | Product category |
| unit_price | Price per unit of the product |
| quantity | Number of units purchased |
| VAT | Value-added tax applied to the purchase |
| total | Final amount paid including VAT |
| date | Date of transaction |
| time | Time of purchase |
| payment_method | Payment method used |
| cogs | Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) |
| gross_margin_percentage | Profit margin percentage |
| gross_income | Profit generated from the transaction |
| rating | Customer rating of the transaction |

## Analytical Approaches
### Product Analysis
- Identify the best and worst-performing product lines.
- Analyze revenue contribution by each product line.
- Determine the most popular payment method.

### Sales Analysis
- Track sales trends over different days and months.
- Identify peak sales hours and busiest days.
- Compare branch-wise sales performance.

### Customer Analysis
- Segment customers based on purchasing patterns.
- Analyze gender distribution per branch.
- Determine the most profitable customer segment.
- Identify peak hours for customer ratings.

## Data Processing Steps
### 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Checked for and handled missing or inconsistent values.
- Structured the dataset into an SQL database.
- Enforced data integrity through constraints.

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Added a `time_of_day` feature to classify transactions into Morning, Afternoon, or Evening.
- Extracted `day_name` and `month_name` for analyzing sales trends by weekdays and months.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Statistical and graphical analysis were conducted to extract key business insights.

## Key Business Insights
- Which city generates the highest revenue?
- What are the top-selling product lines?
- Which customer type contributes the most to revenue?
- Which month sees the highest sales?
- What are the busiest hours of the day for sales?
- Which gender purchases more frequently?
- What is the most commonly used payment method?

## Revenue & Profit Formulas
- **COGS (Cost of Goods Sold):** `unit_price * quantity`
- **VAT (5% of COGS):** `0.05 * COGS`
- **Total Revenue:** `COGS + VAT`
- **Gross Profit:** `Total Revenue - COGS`
- **Gross Margin (%):** `(Gross Profit / Total Revenue) * 100`

### Example Calculation
For a transaction with:
- Unit Price = $45.79
- Quantity = 7

**Computed Values:**
- `COGS = 45.79 * 7 = 320.53`
- `VAT = 0.05 * 320.53 = 16.03`
- `Total Revenue = 320.53 + 16.03 = 336.56`
- `Gross Margin = (16.03 / 336.56) * 100 â‰ˆ 4.76%`

## SQL Database Schema
```sql
-- Create database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS retailSales;

-- Create table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sales(
    invoice_id VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    branch VARCHAR(5) NOT NULL,
    city VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    customer_type VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    gender VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    product_line VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    unit_price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    quantity INT NOT NULL,
    tax_pct FLOAT(6,4) NOT NULL,
    total DECIMAL(12, 4) NOT NULL,
    date DATETIME NOT NULL,
    time TIME NOT NULL,
    payment VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
    cogs DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    gross_margin_pct FLOAT(11,9),
    gross_income DECIMAL(12, 4),
    rating FLOAT(2, 1)
);
```

## Technologies Used
- **SQL (MySQL)** for database management and querying.
- **Excel** for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas & NumPy** for calculations (in Excel).
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (optional for visualization if needed).

## Key Findings
- The **Evening** had the highest sales volume.
- The **Yangon branch** generated the most revenue.
- **Product Line B** had the highest total revenue.
- **Credit Card** was the most frequently used payment method.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into retail sales data, helping businesses optimize sales strategies and improve customer experience. Future enhancements could involve advanced forecasting techniques or deeper machine learning-based analysis.
