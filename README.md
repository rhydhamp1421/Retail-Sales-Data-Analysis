# Retail Sales Data Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing retail sales data to uncover patterns in sales trends, top-performing products, customer behavior, and revenue generation. By studying this data, we aim to provide insights that can help optimize sales strategies and enhance business performance.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project was sourced from the [Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting). It contains transaction records from three retail branches located in Mandalay, Yangon, and Naypyitaw.

## Objectives
- Determine the best-performing branches and product lines.
- Analyze sales patterns across different timeframes.
- Understand customer purchasing behavior.
- Evaluate sales strategies and suggest improvements.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of 1000 records and 17 columns. Below is an overview of the key attributes:

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| invoice_id | Unique identifier for each transaction |
| branch | Store branch where the sale was recorded |
| city | City where the branch is located |
| customer_type | Category of customer (e.g., member, non-member) |
| gender | Customer's gender |
| product_line | Product category |
| unit_price | Price per unit of the product |
| quantity | Number of units purchased |
| VAT | Value-added tax applied to the purchase |
| total | Final amount paid including VAT |
| date | Date of transaction |
| time | Time of purchase |
| payment_method | Payment method used |
| cogs | Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) |
| gross_margin_percentage | Profit margin percentage |
| gross_income | Profit generated from the transaction |
| rating | Customer rating of the transaction |

## Analytical Approaches
### Product Analysis
- Identify best and worst-performing product lines.
- Analyze revenue contribution by each product line.
- Determine the most popular payment method.

### Sales Analysis
- Track sales trends over different days and months.
- Identify peak sales hours and the busiest days.
- Compare branch-wise sales performance.

### Customer Analysis
- Segment customers based on purchasing patterns.
- Analyze gender distribution per branch.
- Determine the most profitable customer segment.
- Identify the peak hours for customer ratings.

## Data Processing Steps
### 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Checked and handled missing or inconsistent values.
- Structured the dataset into an SQL database.
- Enforced data integrity through constraints.

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Added `time_of_day` to classify transactions into Morning, Afternoon, or Evening.
- Extracted `day_name` and `month_name` to analyze sales trends by weekdays and months.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducted statistical and graphical analysis to extract business insights.

## Key Business Insights
1. Which city generates the highest revenue?
2. What are the top-selling product lines?
3. Which customer type contributes the most to revenue?
4. Which month sees the highest sales?
5. What are the busiest hours of the day for sales?
6. Which gender purchases more frequently?
7. What is the most commonly used payment method?

## Revenue & Profit Formulas
- **COGS (Cost of Goods Sold):** `unit_price * quantity`
- **VAT (5% of COGS):** `0.05 * COGS`
- **Total Revenue:** `COGS + VAT`
- **Gross Profit:** `Total Revenue - COGS`
- **Gross Margin (%):** `(Gross Profit / Total Revenue) * 100`

### Example Calculation
For a transaction with:
- Unit Price = $45.79
- Quantity = 7

**Computed Values:**
- `COGS = 45.79 * 7 = 320.53`
- `VAT = 0.05 * 320.53 = 16.0265`
- `Total Revenue = 320.53 + 16.0265 = 336.5565`
- `Gross Margin = (16.0265 / 336.5565) * 100 â‰ˆ 4.76%`

## SQL Database Schema
```sql
-- Create database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS retailSales;

-- Create table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sales(
    invoice_id VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    branch VARCHAR(5) NOT NULL,
    city VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    customer_type VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    gender VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
    product_line VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    unit_price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    quantity INT NOT NULL,
    tax_pct FLOAT(6,4) NOT NULL,
    total DECIMAL(12, 4) NOT NULL,
    date DATETIME NOT NULL,
    time TIME NOT NULL,
    payment VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
    cogs DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    gross_margin_pct FLOAT(11,9),
    gross_income DECIMAL(12, 4),
    rating FLOAT(2, 1)
);
```

## Technologies Used
- **SQL (MySQL)** for database management and querying.
- **Python** for data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for creating visual reports.

## Key Findings
- The **Evening** had the highest sales volume.
- The **Yangon branch** generated the most revenue.
- **Product Line B** had the highest total revenue.
- **Credit Card** was the most frequently used payment method.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into retail sales data, helping to optimize sales strategies and improve customer experience. Future enhancements could include deeper machine learning-based predictive analytics.
